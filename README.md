# QtMark JSON Library

## Description

JSON implementation. Some notable improvements include:

- All JSON values, arrays and objects are stored as gaurded pointers, providing
a simple means to externally maintain a reference to portions of a JSON tree
- Support for custom types, providing a means to automatically marshal /
unmarshal JSON trees into complex C++ Classes.
- Native support for some custom types (providing convience and example)
including QRect, QSize, QPoint and QColor.
- Several convience functions for JSON values, arrays and objects providing
a more developer friendly API.
