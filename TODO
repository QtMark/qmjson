Version 1.0 Todo:

High Priority:
- Add doxygen API comments
- Add remaining unit tests for existing functionaility
- Create QMJsonValue compare function that can take a template type. This
  can then be used by the functions below
- add from QMJsonValue function. Will need to do type conversions
- Add indexOf<XXX> functions for all types (includes added types)
- Add lastIndexOf<XXX> functions for all types (includes added types)
- Add contains<XXX> functions for all types (includes added types)
- Add removeAll<XXX> functions for all types (includes added types)
- Add startsWith<XXX> functions for all types (includes added types)
- Add endsWith<XXX> functions for all types (includes added types)


Low Priority:
- Provide the ability to compare QMJsonValue, QMJsonArray, QMJsonObject
- Add Windows support
- Figure out how to return "const ref" for array and object to speed things
  up a little bit.
- Add count(const T& value) to QMJsonArray
- Default value functions should take a raw type, and a QMJsonValue type
- Add iterator classes to Array and Object so that traditional style looping
  can be done. This will also speed up code on the Object side as they can use
  find.
- Add asserts to the JSON library that can be compiled out
