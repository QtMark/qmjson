Version 1.0 Todo:

High Priority:

- Provide ability to sort on toJson functions
- Remove the QString return on toJsonFile
- Provide default value for value() fucntions
- Remove new QMJsonValue from Object and Array for defaults
- Change type() funciton to enum
- Create typeString() function
- Provide type conversions for the basic types
- Add isEmpty to Array and Object
- Add replace function to Array, and make sure that we are not missing any
  other functions
- Add value functions to QMJsonValue so that you don't have to do
  toObject and toArray constantly.
- Cleanup the pointer types for value, array and object so that they are
  only wrapping json types, then leave the rest to the generic functions

Low Priority:
- Add doxygen API comments
- Add key function to QMJsonObject that does a reverse lookup based on a value
- Add index based contains function to QMJsonArray
- Add convenince functions for QMJsonArray and QMJsonObject to provide the
  ability to save an object or array to file.
